# What is the project?

Elite Eats (EE) is a usable NFT asset. On its utility, EE allows you VIP access to a number of participating restaurant locations in Toronto. As an asset, you can buy your EE NFT directly from this [site]([url](https://rnjudd9.wixsite.com/elite-eats)) and you can also sell your EE NFT membership on the secondary market, such as OpenSea, transferring the same usage rights to the buyer.

# Backend of the Project
We have created a Smart Contract with all functions in relation to buying, transfering and selling an NFT. We have built a user interface using streamlit to buy the NFT. In order to demonstrate the functionality we are using wallet addresses from Ganache. 

# Frontend of the Project
We have created a website using Wix to advertise and present the NFT. The link to view the website is here: https://rnjudd9.wixsite.com/elite-eats
